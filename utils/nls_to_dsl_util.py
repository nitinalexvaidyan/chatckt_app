        Notes for Analysis:
        Summations:

            Aggregate ball-level data to generate match-level insights, such as:
                Total Runs: Calculate the sum of all runs scored (runs_total).
                Wickets: Count the number of dismissals in the match.
                Overs: Compute the total overs bowled in the match using over_no and balls_per_over.
                Example: To determine if a player scored a century in a match, sum up runs_batter at the match_id level.

        Search Suggestions:

            Use wildcard searches for text fields like player names, teams, or venues to manage partial matches and variations.
            Simplify specific names to widely recognized short forms for wildcard searches.
                Examples:
                    Use *kohli* instead of virat kohli.
                    Use *dhoni* instead of MS Dhoni.

        Note for Output:

            Provide step-by-step instructions to construct the query.
            For each step, ensure that the provided instructions are followed without any violations.
            Conclude with a single, complete dsl_query.

        This structure ensures efficient querying and aggregation for cricket analytics."""
